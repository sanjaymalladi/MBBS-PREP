# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1dkVFDF_oEWwPVq2ucQ3hDeKMKqiUWK0O

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, Convex account, Clerk account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Convex:**
   - Create a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) account
   - Run `npx convex dev` to initialize and get your deployment URL
   - Copy the deployment URL to your environment variables

3. **Set up Clerk Authentication:**
   - Create a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
   - Create a new application
   - Copy the publishable key and secret key

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill values
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   - Required vars:
     - `VITE_CONVEX_URL` ‚Äî your Convex deployment URL
     - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` ‚Äî Clerk publishable key
     - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` ‚Äî Clerk secret key (not used on client, keep locally)
     - `GEMINI_API_KEY` ‚Äî Google AI key

5. **Deploy Convex functions:**
   ```bash
   npx convex deploy
   ```

6. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## GitHub Setup

1. Initialize git and commit:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: init repo with Convex + Clerk setup"
   ```
2. Create a GitHub repo and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

This repo includes a `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, and `.env` files. Keep secrets only in `.env` and never commit them.

The AI uses this content to generate new, unique questions while maintaining the same style, difficulty level, and clinical relevance as the original question papers.

## How PDF Content is Used

### üîç **Topic Weightage Analysis**
The system analyzes the PDF content to understand:
- **Frequently tested topics** within each subject area
- **Mark distribution patterns** (12, 8, 5, 3, 1 marks)
- **Clinical focus areas** and applied scenarios
- **Question difficulty progression** from basic to advanced

### üéØ **AI Question Generation**
The enhanced prompt instructs the AI to:
- Study the reference patterns carefully
- Identify high-yield topics and clinical scenarios
- Maintain authentic question structures
- Generate unique questions following the same patterns
- Ensure CBME curriculum alignment

### üìä **Content Insights**
Based on the PDF analysis:
- **Anatomy**: Focus on extremities, thorax, abdomen with clinical correlations
- **Physiology**: Emphasis on cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems
- **Biochemistry**: Metabolism, enzymes, and clinical biochemistry
- **Question Types**: Mix of theoretical, clinical, and applied questions
- **Clinical Integration**: Strong emphasis on applied anatomy and clinical scenarios

This ensures that generated practice sessions are authentic, exam-relevant, and educationally valuable.
